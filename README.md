# Hack & Slash

#### Overview
A hack &amp; slash game made in the Unity Game Engine. I am not legally allowed to post many of the assets here, so I've opted to only include the C# scripts that I wrote.

Many of the fbx files and textures are from one of Synty's asset packs. Animations are from Mixamo. Some of the UI is from free asset packs. In-game HUD is completely mine. Blood effect is custom and made from scratch with Unity's particle systems. All of the game logic is custom except the free-look Camera controls are from Cinemachine.

Used OOP. inheritance, observer and singleton design patterns. Used coroutines, post-processing, Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
